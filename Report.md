## P1

The runtime of part one is .0098 seconds. To avoid the issue of having more than
one edge per connection, I used three nested for loops and two if statements to
make sure that the condition was satisfied.
The complexity of this algorithm is O(G*M^2*L*B).

## P2

The average runtime of part two is .0098 seconds.
With the pathfinding function the memory consumption was 126944 kilobytes.
Without the pathfinding function, the memory consumed was 126836 kilobytes, this
means that the pathfinding function consumes 108 kilobytes.

## P3

The average runtime of part three is .0111 seconds.
With the pathfinding function the memory consumption was 126796 kilobytes.
Without the pathfinding function, the memory consumed was 126728 kilobytes, this
means that the pathfinding function consumes 68 kilobytes.

## P4

The average runtime for building a MST is 2.206 seconds.
